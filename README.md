I have done a simple blog app using Python and Flask.

It allows a user to:
<ul>
    <li>sign up</li>
    <li>login</li>
    <li>reset their password</li>
    <li>upload a profile picture</li>
    <li>post content</li>
</ul>

The user can also update their account's details or a post. <br>
The homepage and user's page have an article section with the latest news, and an API fetches this information. 

At the moment, it isn't possible to upload pictures within a post.

You can view this project live on: https://logged.onrender.com/.
