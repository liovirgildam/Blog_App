I have done a simple blog app using Python and Flask.

It allows a user to:
 sign up, 
 login, 
 reset their password, 
 upload a profile picture, 
 and post content. 

The user can also update their account's details or a post. 
The homepage and user's page have an article section with the latest news, and an API fetches this information. 

At the moment, it isn't possible to upload pictures within a post.

You can view this project live on: https://logged.onrender.com/.
